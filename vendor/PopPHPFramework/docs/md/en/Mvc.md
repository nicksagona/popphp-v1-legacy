Documentation : Mvc
-------------------

Home

The Mvc component, as outlined in the documentation overview, is an
implementation of the MVC design pattern, with the additional layer of a
router to facilitate multiple user paths and controllers. Simply put,
the controller handles the delegation of requests, the model handles the
business logic and the view determines how to display the output to the
user. All of these classes within this component are very easy to extend
to leverage them within your own application.

While this may look overly complex, if you use the CLI component project
installation feature, most of this code can be written and installed for
you. You just have to define the project name and settings in the
install configuration file. View the Project component doc file to get
an example of a project install configuration file.

    use Pop\Mvc\Controller,
        Pop\Mvc\Router,
        Pop\Mvc\View,
        Pop\Project\Project;

    // Define your project class
    class MyProject extends Project
    {
        // Extend the parent 'run' method to establish router paths
        public function run()
        {
            parent::run();
        }
    }

    class MyModel
    {
        // Perhaps does something special pertaining to whatever data you are manipulating
    }

    class MyController extends Controller
    {
        // Constructor
        public function __construct(Request $request = null, Response $response = null, Project $project = null, $viewPath = null)
        {
            if (null === $viewPath) {
                $viewPath = __DIR__ . '/path/to/my/view';
            }

            parent::__construct($request, $response, $project, $viewPath);
        }

        // Your home page
        public function index()
        {
            $model = new MyModel(array('username' => 'myusername');
            $this->view = View::factory($this->viewPath . '/index.phtml', $model->getmyData()); // This would return an array into the view object
            $this->send();
        }

        // Your 404 page
        public function error()
        {
            $this->view = View::factory($this->viewPath . '/error.phtml');
            $this->send(404);
        }
    }

    // Create a project object, to define the project config, router and controller(s)
    $project = MyProject::factory(
        include '../some/config/project.php',
        include '../some/config/module.php',
        new Router(array(
            '/' => 'MyApp\MyController'
        ))
    );

    // Run the project
    $project->run();
